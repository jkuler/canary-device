## DEVICE SENSOR APPLICATION ABSTRACT
<p>When hund
reds of thousands of hardware devices are concurrently uploading sensors data, performance, availability, 
and scalability are questions that needed to be answered while designing the infrastructure to sustain the system.</p>
<p>In this scenario, I choose to deploy the system on cloud service where scalability, and high availability can be provided within couple of minutes.  
The following graphic describes an integration infrastructure design where the application will be deployed</p>
